# Telling-Stories-With-Data-Spring-2021
Hi, this is Christina Ip's portfolio page for Telling Stories With Data Spring 2021.

# About me
Hello! I'm Christina Ip and my pronouns are she/her. I am a MA Design Candidate at Carnegie Mellon School of Design. I'm a visual designer who wants to improve on how to communicate clearly and holistically in my work. I studied Mathematics and English during undergrad but also took several art/design courses. From there, I could see design was present in many subjects and wanted to study it further. Because of my background, I am interested in data and how it can be portrayed and really help drive in a point. I hope to take these skills and work as a UX/UI Designer or a Product Designer in the future.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to combine design and data through visual graphics to become a better, more understandable designer. Because I don't have a traditional background in design, learning about fundamentals such as color or clarity to represent work helps me to improve as a designer. I am also looking forward to becoming more familiar with coding websites such as GitHub!

## Final Project

# Government Spending on Pension Benefits by Country
For class 2/8, we briefly went over how to make a graph on Datawrapper. Here's mine.

# King County Cumulative Case Counts (Feb 28 - April 12th)
For class 2/10, we went over how to make a graph on Flourish. The original data can be found here:

# General Government Debt (2/12/21) 
For our assignment this week, we created a graph based on the general government debt varying coutry from country. The information we collected describes the debt recorded from 1995 to 2018. As described from OECD's website, "General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits." (https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) 

Here's data directly taken from OECD.

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6gJK" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6gJK" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 1995 â€“ 2018</a></iframe>

To compare each listed country's debt from the years 1995-2018, we used Flourish to create a graph for each country. Because there are so many variables, separating each country into its own chart can help distinguish a few differences quickly without putting too much strain on the eyes. For example, you can see which country's debt is consistently rising or declining.

Using this data again, I've created another similar chart but stacked the lines up instead. The reason I believe the "stacked" chart might be more appropriate because we are talking about debt. Additionally, I changed the color to red, becuse this associates with negative figures, which is what debt is referring to. As each government continues to spend more than it takes in, the debt rises which is depicted in certin countries. See the highlighted areas grow or decrease can feel more significant because our eyes are drawn to these areas. For example, Estonia feels a lot less concerning than Japan, who seems to continue rising each year. 
 
I continued to keep the countries separated to prevent overcrowding the graph. I felt like having each individual chart kept a clear visual that was pleasant in a group and stood strongly alone, if needed. Even if I had categorized the countries in their respective continents, I felt like some categories would just be too large. Therefore, I believe having a grid of stacked line charts would be the best way.

# Assignment 3 & 4

For the homework assignment this week, I found an article on how the ages of Nobel winners seem to be increasing. I chose this article/data set because while I thought it was effective in showing data for their story but there were a few adjustments that could be made. The data was separated by each Nobel prize category, which was visually appealing to fit as a header image and we could see a rising trend in age (except in Peace) that worked with their story but I thought the data was forcibly dense in some areas and didn't show comparisons fairly. I also found the smooth curved trending line they used to prove their point to work in some categories but not in some.

From the critique, I thought about how I could display the data as a whole or other ways of comparison, i.e. the ages of nobel prize winners in categories from 1900-1950 compared to 1950-2016 in a stacked bar chart. However, while it was easy to see the comparisons this way and this was data was over a wide time period and I thought it was important to display that. Because of this I thought about using a line graph to show the trend lines over time overall but this wouldn't show the outliers at all and this was a key component of the data. From the feedback, it sounded like most people would like to see the data as a whole because of the time span, so I stayed with the scatterplot but made some changes.

I used Flourish to plot all the data on a scatterplot. Once the data was spread apart over a large x-axis, you could see while there was an increase in age, it wasn't as dramatic as the original visualization. This made a huge difference, espcially when you could separate the data in each category. You could also see how wide the gaps were in a single year or how the changes varied year to year. However, the data the story implied was correct - there was a rising trend in age but it was not as significant as it seemed. To display this trend, I set up a general linear trend line that helped showed that it wasn't as significant as it seems and would show how varied the data was. In this recreation of data visualization, I found how important the spacing of each graph was and how it could be very persuasive.
