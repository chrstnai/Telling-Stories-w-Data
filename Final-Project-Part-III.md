# The Rise of Hate Crimes Against Asian Americans Pacific Islanders Part III

## Finishing Up

Moving on from Part 2, I started refining my research, the text, and data visualizations to match a certain theme. From feedback, I think it was important to utilize the design of the webpage to play a bigger factor in conveying my story. Editing my photos to be darker and using a contrasting red color as a highlight had dramatized the text. I received a few positive comments about the scrolling figures on the left to display the number of crimes even if it didn’t work as well on Shorthand as I hoped. This feature was one of the ways I tried to connect with the audience more as well as adding links to the actual stories that happened. From this, I felt like the audience could connect to the material and also become more engaged. Lastly, my call to action section became more of a resource area to report a crime, read and learn more. I found that after reading these articles, I did not know what to do with this information besides donate and keep myself updated and alert. There were other ways to help, possibly just becoming more informed about how and why this was happening. To do this, links to resources like books and mental health organizations were provided aside from the non-profits.

In between Parts 2 and 3, my story had developed into not just bringing awareness of recent Asian American Pacific Islander hate crimes but also educating my audience on the history surrounding it and the common misconceptions that they still experience today. When I was reading a few articles, specifically this [one](https://time.com/5938482/asian-american-attacks/) by Time Magazine, I realized the way these news articles were written did not only point out the data but also kept me engaged by introducing related educational information. It was a key aspect to storytelling. 

Some of the challenges I found were how some statistics/use of data could be misleading. For example, there was a common statistic thrown around regarding the NYPD hate crime increase of 1900%. Some articles, however, didn’t report the actual number of hate crimes, which was actually only 3 to 28. Similarly, other cities that jumped from 0 to 2 or 2 to 4 could also report an over 100% increase. While this is still worth noting, it can be misleading. I thought showing this increase along with other cities would be more effective for the story instead and more transparent over the percentage difference. I also thought this graph was more effective than just showing one or two city's dramatic increase (what I had planned to do with NYPD information). With several major US cities, it was more liklely to have an audience member connect with one of the places and could draw their attention.

My intended audience stayed the same from the beginning to the end. I wanted to keep this to the general public because it was a subject that still hadn’t received a lot of coverage and there was so much more to talk about than just the hate crimes such as the stigma against the APPI community, treatment and history. Additionally, new information was always being added. In fact, Stop APPI Hate had just released a more detailed report on March 17 (the day the project was due) that the crimes had risen to 3795. Because there so much information and topics to discuss, I kept it geared to the general public in hopes at least one topic in my story would be new.

Overall, when I was working with this data set, I thought I had an idea of what to do but it gradually changed because I didn’t realize how much information I didn’t know or how many other systemic problems were tied into it. This led to a few challenges like knowing when and how to zoom in and out of a subject, keeping your audience engaged, and being honest with your data. When writing a story like this, I was reminded of how important it was to stay flexible especially when you don’t have the data sets that you thought you would have. However, I felt like in most cases, there’s enough data to drive your point when you frame it right.
