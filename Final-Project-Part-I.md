# The Rise of Hate Crimes Against Asian Americans Part I

Link to [Part II](Final-Project-Part-II.md) and [Part III](Final-Project-Part-III.md) 

# Outline
Hate crimes against Asian Americans are rapidly growing since the start of the COVID pandemic. As a reader, I want to know why they are rising so that I raise awareness on this topic and provide support to Asian commmunities. My call to action is to provide resources to help these communities, raise awareness, and provide educational resources to learn and understand why this is happening.


# Why this subject? What do I want to tell? Project Structure
Since the beginning of COVID, hate crimes against Asian Americans have gone up tremendously and there has been little media coverage over this in comparison to the amount of crimes. Much of the news regarding this subject was first reported through popular media websites such as NextShark. Only a few significant stories involving death or extremely injured victims were receiving more coverage on media such as WSJ and NY Times. (Show data here of the crimes rising) Much of these attacks are due to the rise of xenophobia and racism against Asians after the start of the COVID pandemic. With a former president and other politicians calling the virus, the Chinese Flu or the Wuhan Virus, this language had spread to general public and created a stigma against Asian Americans. This xenophobia was also added to by popular news outlets like NY Times who would use photos of Chinatown and Asian Americans as header images when speaking about COVID and created associations that were unnecessary. (Here I would use refences to articles)

With these events, a sense of fear among Asian communities grew as agressive and violent behavior increased. Many of the attacks are directed to people who lack the power to fight back physically such as the elderly. Children and teenagers are also experiencing forms of racism in their schools and daily lives (Show youth data of number of reported slurs from AAPI) It's heartbreaking to see this uncovered by the media and I would like to share some of these stories.

I also want to provide resources to learn more and help out. Because this is not getting covered in media as often as it should, it's hard to find data on this subject and places that people can go to for support. There are groups such as the NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force or local Chinatown communities that are helping out by offering walks, protection and funds to those who need it. (Put resources at the end)

# Sketches
Below are some sketches I will be creating visualizations for.

I think I'll start with this graph first to show the increase of crimes in comparison from 2019 to 2020. 
1900% is an increase that's pretty hard to visualize, so I think a comparison would would be start the story strong. I think maybe showing the increase through an animation would be effective. I would want to see the visual percentage like the size of a circle or dots growing 1900%.

I would also show a line graph comparison to show how the crimes rose in a span of a few months in 2020 as compared to 2019. The start of COVID in the US was in March and you should be to see the continued rise of crimes from there. Here, I think the media coverage is important because of how they started using Asian communities photos for their articles and how politicians kept using the name "Chinese Virus."  While this quick sketch only shows NY data, I would also show other places such as Georgia and LA as a comparison and also inform readers it is happening in multiple places.

There are all types of crimes happening from physical to verbal. While only a few of the stories are being shared online, they are mostly violent. I also want to include those like name-calling and online threats as well. I can also add reports of what Asian Americans children are being treated like in school.

I think showing the number of crimes would be significant in comparison to 1 person. I'm thinking of creating a visualization of 1700 human figures would show the sheer numbers of crimes/reports.

# Data/Reports to Work with

The below are the data sets and reports I found. 

From the American Bar Report and UN Report, there is information on what kind of violent crimes are occuring such as physical alteractions, name calling, shaming, and more. I would most likely use a circle graph here to display the variety of crimes that are happening. These reports will be used to show where these events are receiving coverage and also to show how it is happening all over the US.

UN Report;

The following NY 2020 Report has the recorded amount of arrests made in 2020 due to hate crime separated by bias. I hope to use this to show the number of crimes related to Asian Americans and how it has changed over the last year. 

NYPD Hate Crime Reports:

Majority of my data will becoming from Stop AAPI Hate, an organization dedicated to spreading news and collecting reports on this subject. Some of their reports are in specific areas like LA or Georgia, so I might try to use a comparison of locations that these crimes are happening in. There is also data on what kind of crimes are happening here (Similar to the bar report). I can split these up to focus on in general reports and also one for youths because its more of a sensitive topic.

# Method & Medium
I will be using Shorthand to develop my website and tell this story. I also will be trying to take my own photos for this project. The way I want to tell the story is first through the large quanities of numbers and get through the number of crimes that are happening. I will also be adding hyperlinks to stories that have been reported because there are so many.

To begin my story, I will first show the data like Berinato recommended. (Most likely the 1900% increase) From there, I will be describing some potential causes like the lack of attention in media and the xenophobia spread of politicians and other new sources. I can add in how these numbers are increasing in cities and places all over the United States. Here, I think most of the graphs and visuzaltions about hate crimes will lie.

Moving on, I think I can also give some history on Asian communities as well to give more insight to why this is not being covered. Here I can also touch a little bit on the Model Minority myth and also add some background on the percentage of the population Asians make up.

Finally to end, I want to include resources to help this cause like as AAPI and local non-profits in NY & LA. This would be my call-to-action area because I think there knowing all this information is helpful but also having resources to go to is vital. AAPI has numerous resources to go to for this.
